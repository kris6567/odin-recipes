        <li>Add ground pork, onion, sesame oil, egg, salt, garlic powder, and pepper. Mix well.</li>
        <li>Lay a piece of wonton wrapper flat on a plate. Scoop 1 1/2 teaspoon of the mixture and place on the middle of the wrapper. Fold the wonton wrapper to form a triangle. Press the sides to keep the meat mixture intact. Gold both sides of the triangle wrapper inward. Set aside. Do this step until the pork mixture is completely consumed.
